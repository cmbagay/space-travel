      <h1>Space Travel: Expanding Horizons Beyond Earth</h1>

      <h2>🌌Journey Into the Future🌌</h2>
      <p>In the not-so-distant future, where technology has evolved by leaps and bounds, humanity has achieved the unimaginable: they have successfully transformed other planets in the solar system into habitable environments. </p>

      <h2>🌎From Neglect to Innovation🌎</h2>
      <p>Once the cradle of humanity, Earth had become a shadow of its former self due to centuries of neglect and environmental degradation. </p>

      <h2>🚀Enter Space Travel: Where Dreams Take Flight🧑‍🚀</h2>
      <p>As a result, the focus of humankind had shifted beyond Earth's boundaries, and the key to their interplanetary exploration lay in a cutting-edge web application called "Space Travel." The web application's users are commanders who will use it to evacuate humankind from the Earth. </p>

      <h2>🛠️Engineer, Explorer, Leader🛠️</h2>
      <p>Our ingenious web application is planned to enable users to list all spacecraft, view the details of a spacecraft, build a new one, and destroy the old one. But the capabilities of it continue beyond that as well; it is planned to enable users to view planets with the spacecraft on it and send spacecraft from one planet to another to transfer people.</p>
